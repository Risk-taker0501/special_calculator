# Calculator App using React

This is a calculator app built using React that can handle special equations and provides optimized code.

## Overview

The calculator app allows users to perform basic arithmetic calculations using special equations. It is built using React and styled-components for styling.

## Features

- Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.
- Handles special equations with multiple operands and operators.
- Optimized code for efficient calculation.

## Usage

To use the calculator app, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies by running `npm install` in the project directory.
3. Start the development server with `npm start`.
4. Open the app in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Code Explanation

The main logic of the calculator app resides in the `calculate` function. It takes in an equation string and evaluates it to return the result. The function uses a stack-based approach to handle multiple operands and operators.

The user interface is built using styled-components, which provides a convenient way to style React components.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the calculator:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import Calculator from './Calculator';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Calculator App</h1>
      <Calculator />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
